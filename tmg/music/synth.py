"""Sound out of arithmetic: oscillators, envelopes, filters, space.

Everything here is numpy on float64 arrays and nothing else. No scipy, no
model, no GPU: it was written for a station that had no GPU at all, and it
still runs anywhere. Here it is the orchestrator; the neural sources (phase 6)
sit beside it, not inside it.

Two rules shape the code:

* **No per-sample Python loops.** A five-minute stereo track is thirteen
  million samples per channel; a loop over those in Python would take longer
  than the track. Anything that has to vary over time varies per *block*.
* **Filters work in the frequency domain.** A resonant filter is recursive by
  nature, and recursion is the one thing numpy cannot vectorise. Shaping the
  spectrum of overlapping windows gives the same sweep for a fraction of the
  effort, and a sweep is what trance is made of.
