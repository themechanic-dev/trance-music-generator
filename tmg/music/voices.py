"""The instruments: one function per sound, each returning a mono array.

A voice knows its own shape and nothing about the arrangement — no bar, no
tempo, no position. The composer decides when a voice speaks and how loud;
everything here answers only "what does it sound like".

Tuning is equal temperament from A4 = 440 Hz, which is why every voice takes
a frequency rather than a note name: transposing a whole track is then one
multiplication instead of a lookup table.
